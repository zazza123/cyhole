"""
    This file is used to load and manage all the tests' configurations.

    The 'cyhole' library interacts with many external API that requires 
    an API Key in order to extract data. Since the usage of these API Keys 
    is subjected to costs, a proper configuration for the tests was required.

    The configuration is managed by a 'test.ini' file loaded during the 
    execution of the tests. By using this file will be possible to:
        - manage API Keys externally
        - enable/disable mock responses

    Check the default 'test.ini' file for a complete list of available configurations.

    Mock Responses
    If the mock response functionality is enabled, then the tests try to load a JSON file 
    with the response stored from a previous extration from the API.
    Moreover, every time the tests are executed with the mock response functionality 
    disabled, the process automatically stores the response in a JSON file into the 
    proper resources folder.
